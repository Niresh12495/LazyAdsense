## Lazy load Adsense ads with Intersection Observer


Lazy Adsense is an open source javascript library that support lazy loading adsense ads when the ads are visible in viewport.

What is lazy loading?
Lazy loading is the practice of delaying load or initialization of resources or objects until they’re actually needed to improve performance and save system resources.

## Advantage of Lazy Loading

- On-demand loading reduces time consumption and memory usage thereby optimizing content delivery. As only a fraction of the web page, which is required, is loaded first thus, the time taken is less and the loading of rest of the section is delayed which saves storage. All of this enhances the user’s experience as the requested content is fed in no time.
- Unnecessary code execution is avoided.
- Optimal usage of time and space resources makes it a cost-effective approach.
